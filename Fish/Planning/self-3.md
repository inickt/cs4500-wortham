## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 3

Under each of the following elements below, indicate below where your
TAs can find:

- the data description of states, including an interpretation:
    - https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/atlanta/blob/6fa5e07b60d531a4ba1d8b2359a842da05c10042/Fish/Common/src/common/gamestate.rs#L35-L49
    - Our data description is given by our struct definition which contains each field with descriptive names
      and comments for any invariants and additional points of clarification.

- a signature/purpose statement of functionality that creates states 
    - https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/atlanta/blob/6fa5e07b60d531a4ba1d8b2359a842da05c10042/Fish/Common/src/common/gamestate.rs#L52-L56

- unit tests for functionality of taking a turn 
    - https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/atlanta/blob/6fa5e07b60d531a4ba1d8b2359a842da05c10042/Fish/Common/src/common/gamestate.rs#L232-L266

- unit tests for functionality of placing an avatar 
    - https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/atlanta/blob/6fa5e07b60d531a4ba1d8b2359a842da05c10042/Fish/Common/src/common/gamestate.rs#L199-L230

- unit tests for functionality of final-state test
    - https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/atlanta/blob/6fa5e07b60d531a4ba1d8b2359a842da05c10042/Fish/Common/src/common/gamestate.rs#L158-L197

The ideal feedback is a GitHub perma-link to the range of lines in specific
file or a collection of files for each of the above bullet points.

  WARNING: all such links must point to your commit "6fa5e07b60d531a4ba1d8b2359a842da05c10042".
  Any bad links will result in a zero score for this self-evaluation.
  Here is an example link:

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

In either case you may wish to, beneath each snippet of code you
indicate, add a line or two of commentary that explains how you think
the specified code snippets answers the request.
